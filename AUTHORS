Li Heng, lh3@sanger.ac.uk, was the original author and chief programmer of
treebest.

Du Wenfeng, duwf@genomics.org.cn, was the author of dn/ds calculator. His
creative idea accelerated the calculation speed by far.

Guan Liang, guanl@genomics.org.cn, was the author of nh2pic, a wonderful
NHX->FIGURE convertor. Although I do not use his codes any longer, I still
appreciate his contribution to TreeBeST.

Liu Tao, liutao@genomics.org.cn, was the author of goTree.pl, a wapper for
the famous `puzzle' and `phyml' tree-builder.
