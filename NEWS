Beta Release 1.9.0 (10 October, 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the last release managed by the CVS located on my own laptop. I will
migrate the whole NJTREE source codes to treesoft subversion repository, hosted
by SourceForge.net. The historical version before this release of NJTREE cannot
be tracked any longer, but ChangeLog is still available showing the path of
NJTREE.

From this release, NJTREE will be released more frequently. The version number
will also differ from the previous ones. I will not use "release candidate" or
"rc" any more. Instead, version is always named by "x.y.z" where "x" indicates
major version, "y" minor version and "z" means bug fix release. A release can
be a beta one, which will be clarified in the corresponding release note, but
is not always visible from the version number.

So far as subversion structures are concerned, release and beta release will
always stay at the top of "trunk". A "dev" will be created in "branches" for
main-thread development. A tag will be applied to each release or beta release.
I prefer not to create a branch for bug fixes unless this is absolutely
necessary. Bug fixes usually happen at the top of "dev" branch and then will
be merged to the "trunk".

Now, come to the changes since release 1.0.0. The most notable changes in this
release is the use of a species tree and/or a constraining tree in building ML
trees. This is done by multiplying extra likelihood terms to the original
likelihood calculated from sequences evolution. During the development of this
function, I also made it possible to root a gene tree by SDI in O(N^2) time
(or O(N logN) in average). Fast rooting makes the new tree builder practically
useful. Other minor changes are:

* Infer apparent orthologs, named by Ensembl Compara group. But my definition
  is slightly different from theirs.

* Accelerate several functions.

* Improve the command-line interfaces for `phyml' and `best' modules.

* Compatible with gcc-3.4 and gcc-4.1.

* Compatible with MINGW and MacOS X.

* Add more species into the species tree. Now in the mammalian group, the
  topology of the species tree is identical to the NCBI taxonomy. However,
  for now I do not know whether this is a good idea or not.



Release 1.0.0 (06 July, 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After nearly two years, I decide to release the first version 1.0.0. This does
not mean I plan to stop the project, but means I prepare to inject new methods
and ideas which may impair the stability of the current codes. NJTREE-1.0.0
has been heavily tested in building TreeFam-3, and is proved to be quite stable
when TreeFam data are provided.

Notable changes are:

* New modules: 'pwalign', 'mmerge', 'sortleaf' and 'estlen'.

* New distance: nt-mm, the mismatch distance for nucleotide alignment.

* Merge multiple trees. Functions for merging two trees are removed. The new
  algorithm is also able to consider bootstrapping supports. Now 'dm' tree
  is built by merging 'dn', 'ds' and 'ntmm' trees, and 'best' tree by merging
  the three trees above plus 'phyml-HKY' and 'phyml-WAG' trees.

* PHYML part:
  1. Accelerate PHYML by about 20%.
  2. Integrate PHYML to FLNJTREE, the NJTREE GUI.
  3. Add names of internal nodes to the PHYML tree.
  4. PHYML bootstrapping is avaible.

* Mask low-scoring segments. See CLUSTALX paper for more description.

* Calculate topological distance (Robinson-Foulds distance) between two trees.

* TreeFam-3 species tree.

* Reserve NHX information of the input tree.

* A lot of bug fixes.



Beta Release 0.2.0-rc5 (01 December, 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of bug fixes and improvements have been achieved since the last release.
Integrating `align_lib' and hash library written by me, and the masterpiece
`phyml' as well, njtree becomes more powerful and flexible. It is now capable
of constructing ML tree, building protein-guided nucleotide alignment,
reordering leaves and many other new functions. It also comes with a GUI which
will make biologists feel more friendly.

Notable changes are:

* Incorporate phyml. ML tree and likelihood mapping are available.

* Implement GUI (Graphical User Interface) by using FLTK, a cross-platform GUI
  library.

* Build protein-guided nucleotide alignment.

* Reorder leaves according to another tree, or to the species of the leaves.
  This will make it easy to compare similar trees.

* Information stored in NHX format is now fully parsed and stored in a hash.
  Tag `Sd' and `G' will also be added by `njtree' itself instead of by
  additional scripts.

* Implement unrooted constrained NJ for binary constraints.

* Simulate a gene tree based on a species tree by randomly generating
  duplications and losses.

* A batch of bug fixes.

Version 1.0 will be released if no other bugs are found.



Beta Release 0.2.0-rc4 (10 April, 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a long time, and finally a new beta release is coming out. It seems
that I have forgotten to add a tag for 0.2.0-rc3, and so I can only
compare the current version with tag RELEASE-0-2-0-rc2-bk9 that is
presumably identical to 0.2.0-rc3.

The most notable change in this release is "tree merging" strategy. By
tree merging, dS and dN trees can be combined in a more reasonable way.
Other changes include:

* Implement a new algorithm to do gene loss inference. This one complies
  with the original meaning of `gene loss'.

* Add Du Wenfeng to AUTHOR.

* Add `distmat' component.

* Add time limit to tune the number of bootstraps.

* Code clean-up, efficiency improvements  and numerous bug fixes.



Beta Release 0.2.0-rc3 (28 January, 2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We here claim a new beta release of NJTREE. Bugs are fixed and many new
functions added including SDI tree rooting, improved ortholog inference,
dN-dS mixed distance, and leaf, mfa2aln and ortho components.

Other notable changes are:

* `leaf' component: get names of external nodes
  `mfa2aln' component: convert fasta format to quality-assigned aln format
  `ortho' component: ortholog inference

* Add version checking in run_njtree.pl and cgi_njtree.pl.

* Remove gapped columns in multialignment

* Output full FASTA header line

Many new functions are added to BRANCH-0-2-0-rc2-bk9, an unstable working
branch for the next release.



Beta Release 0.2.0-rc2 (12 December, 2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The major revisions in this release include adding nucleotide alignment
support and NJTREE user's manual. Now phylogenetic trees can be built from
nucleotide alignment in coding regions with d_s or d_n distances.

Other notable changes are:

* Fix SDI bugs when multifurcated species nodes are encountered. In previous
  release, this function is not fully tested.

* Fix floating point exception on alpha-True64.

* Add `trans' and `filter' components.

* nh2pic can still be compiled when GD package is lacked, but only EPS output
  is support at this time.



Beta Release 0.2.0-rc1 (29 November, 2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first formal release of njtree, a tree-builder by constrained
neighbour-joining algorithm. This package is also capable of SDI (Speciation
vs. Duplication Inference), tree rooting, figure output and many other
utilities, facilitating tree-building routains.

Njtree is initiated by TreeFam project inspired by Richard Durbin. The basic
idea is to build a full tree constrained by the human curated seed tree. As we
will handle a batch of large trees, this process must be controlled and fast
enough. Allowing for multifurcated nodes makes the things more complex: SDI
algorithm only works with binary species trees. These demands disqualify all
the current softwares. So we wrote njtree, a fast and capable tree builder
according to these requirments. The basic framework of njtree might not be
brand-new, but njtree must be the program you want in practice.
