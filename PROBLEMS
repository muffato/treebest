* Component 'backtrans' has not been thoroghly tested.

* For branch-based bootstrapping, bootstrap values will still stick to
  the nodes instead of branches. When the tree is re-rooted, this will
  cause trouble. So I strongly recommend to use node-based
  bootstrapping, which is the default behaviour.

* Memory violation still occurs in rare cases, especially in
  `fltreebest'. I will fix them one by one.

* Unrooted constrained NJ now only works with binary constrained trees.

* Some new functionalities should be added to FLtreeBeST.
