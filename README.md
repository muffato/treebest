# treebest
My git clone of Heng Li's treebest from http://sourceforge.net/p/treesoft/code/HEAD/tree/branches/lh3/ .
It shows the history of the code, as opposite to Heng Li's version on [GitHub](https://github.com/lh3/treebest) which imports the whole codebase as just 1 commit.

I am **not** maintaining this software, this repository is for a historical purpose only.
